## üöÄ VERSION RELEASE HISTORY

### V1.0.7 - Version Display Fix (January 15, 2025)
**Status**: ‚úÖ RELEASED - Available on GitHub

#### What Was Fixed
- **Version Display Issue**: Application was showing "v1.0" instead of correct version number
- **Root Cause**: VersionService was only reading Major.Minor instead of full version
- **UI Impact**: Login screen and main window title showed incorrect version

#### Technical Changes Made
- **Project File**: Updated version from 1.0.6 to 1.0.7 in PokerTracker2.csproj
- **VersionService.cs**: Changed from `$"{version.Major}.{version.Minor}"` to `version.ToString()`
- **Fallback Values**: Updated all fallback version strings to 1.0.7.0

#### Files Modified
- `PokerTracker2/PokerTracker2.csproj` - Version bump to 1.0.7
- `PokerTracker2/Services/VersionService.cs` - Version reading logic fix
- `AIMANIFEST.txt` - Updated with v1.0.7 release information

#### Release Process
- **Build**: ‚úÖ Successful with 206 warnings (no errors)
- **Publish**: ‚úÖ Application published to PublishSingle directory
- **Git Operations**: ‚úÖ Tag v1.0.7 created and committed
- **GitHub Release**: ‚úÖ Successfully created at https://github.com/Doodooflames/PokerTracker2/releases/tag/v1.0.7
- **Executable**: ‚úÖ PokerTracker2.exe (12MB) uploaded

#### User Experience Impact
- **Before**: Application showed "v1.0" in login and title bars
- **After**: Application now shows "v1.0.7.0" correctly
- **Consistency**: All UI elements display the same, accurate version

#### Lessons Learned
- **Version Caching**: VersionService caches version information and must be updated when version changes
- **Fallback Values**: All fallback version strings must be updated to match new project version
- **Best Practice**: Always update both .csproj version AND VersionService fallback values together
