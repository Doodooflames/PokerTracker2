you seem to have misunderstood. the add player button should be where its pictured right now, but look at the active session panel in the second picture, thats where i wanted the add player button. also while were at it, the button icons for adding a buy in or a cash out seem weird and i cant tell the meaning from the picture, can you fix that?
